Unit Testing
============

The **_tests_** folder contains ~~scripts~~ _test suites_ that ensure the proper
implementation of the _functions_ created on **_lib_** folder.  In order to
execute the Unit Tests defined for this project, you must run the following
command:

    $ ./tools/run.sh testing [test_suite] [function]

Examples
--------

    $ ./tools/run.sh testing # Executes all the Unit Tests
    $ ./tools/run.sh testing functions # Executes all the Unit Tests of Functions Test Suite
    $ ./tools/run.sh testing functions install_maven # Executes the install_maven Unit Test of Functions Test Suite
